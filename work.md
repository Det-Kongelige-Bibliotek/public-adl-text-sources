## The ADL work

ADL uses a work concept developed together with the original service
some 15 years ago by experienced reference librarians. It is
completely pragmatic and related to what their needs were when helping
patrons by providing pointers to texts in the information desk.

There the most common questions about literature were about

* individual poems, songs and psalms
* individual short stories
* novels and other longer pieces of prose (basically: "books")
* plays

With the exception for novels, most of these works are text fragments
inside a volume, the unit delivered by the library's circulation desk.
